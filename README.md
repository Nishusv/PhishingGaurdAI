 Project Title:
Live Phishing URL Detection Using Machine Learning

📝 Project Description:
The Live Phishing URL Detection System is a cybersecurity application designed to identify and mitigate phishing attacks in real-time by analyzing suspicious URLs using machine learning techniques. This system helps protect users from falling victim to malicious websites that aim to steal sensitive data such as login credentials, banking information, or personal identity.

The system leverages trained machine learning models to classify URLs as legitimate or phishing based on various lexical, domain, and behavioral features. It also offers a user interface (web or mobile) where users can input or report URLs and receive instant feedback on their safety status.

🎯 Key Features:
🔍 Real-Time URL Analysis
Users can submit a URL and get an immediate risk assessment.

🧠 Machine Learning-Based Detection
Uses supervised ML algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, or Logistic Regression) trained on phishing and legitimate URL datasets.

🌐 WHOIS & Domain Analysis
Evaluates the domain age, registration length, and trust score using external APIs.

🧪 Lexical Feature Extraction
Extracts features like:

URL length

Number of special characters

Presence of suspicious keywords (e.g., “login”, “verify”)

📊 Threat Scoring
URLs are given a phishing probability or a “safe/risky” label.

🚨 Report URL to Authorities
Includes a feature to report confirmed phishing links to national cybercrime platforms (e.g., https://cybercrime.gov.in).

📱 Responsive UI (Web/Mobile)
A user-friendly interface built with React, Flutter, or native Android for smooth interaction.
